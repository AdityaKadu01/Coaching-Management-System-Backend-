            <h3>About The Coaching</h3><br/>
JRS Tutorials came into existence in the year 1994 when a group of teachers led by a young technocrat decided to provide a platform for preparation of National level Engineering and Medical enterance examinations, an area of education which the city of Varanasi, a seat of learning, was lacking in. Since, then it has traversed a long path of glory and success. It has proved to be a seat of Quality education and a blessing to the aspiring students, helping them to succeed in competitive examinations.
JRS is a team and every member of the tram is vowed and dedicated for the cause of individual's qualitative development to achieve his mission in life. Strength of JRS lies in its very strong efficient, experienced and fully devoted team of teachers. Our classroom teaching provides a very systematic and exhaustive coverage of the syllabus providing the students with best of education and information. Almost all our teachers are full timer and pay greater attention to post class discussion and solution of problems. Patient hearing to the problems of every individual is given and niggling doubts are removed to their satisfaction.

Topic wise tests and combined tests are conducted regularly to judge the preparation of the students. Tests and course covered are perfectly coordinated. These tests work as real shield to counter the final examination the students aspire for. Our combined tests are very systematically mixed with topic wise tests and develops a very strong competitive spirit among the students, which motivates them to forge ahead in order to achieve their goal.
